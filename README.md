# Deep Reinforcement Learning with Coalition Action Selection

This repository contains the implementation for the paper:  
**[Deep Reinforcement Learning with Coalition Action Selection for Online Combinatorial Resource Allocation with Arbitrary Action Space](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3635637.3662918)**.  

A detailed description of the method and results is also provided in **Chapter 3** of my [PhD thesis](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=17hsRTkAAAAJ&citation_for_view=17hsRTkAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC).

## Overview
This work introduces a deep reinforcement learning framework with **coalition-based action selection** to handle online combinatorial resource allocation problems with large or arbitrary action spaces.  
The approach is designed to improve scalability and decision efficiency in complex environments where traditional DRL methods struggle due to the exponential growth of possible actions.
